# inlang-t-function-jsx-hybrid-matcher

this plugin is a modification of the official `t-function matcher` plugin, with the following changes:
- [x] support several custom translate function names (instead of just `t`)
- [x] add gui configuration in sherlock
- [ ] support custom JSX attributes on react components (later)
